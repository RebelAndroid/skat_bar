Skat Bar is a trick taking card game created by me and my friends.

Dealing:
  2 players - both players get 9 cards and 2 piles of 2 cards are placed face down on the table (these are the "Skat Bars").
  3 players - each player gets 6 cards and 2 piles of 2 cards are placed face down on the table.
  4 players - each player gets 5 cards and 2 cards are placed face down on the table.

Rules:
  Skat Bar uses the opposite of a skat deck: twos through sixes and the 2 jokers.
  Both jokers are always trump and are the highest cards. The black and white joker (the "guarantee") is higher.
  Trump is a color and even or odd (red even, red odd, black even, or black odd).
  The player to the left of the dealer chooses one part of trump (red, black, odd, or even).
  The next player chooses the other part of trump (in 2 player Skat Bar, this is the dealer).
  The next player starts the first trick.
  In a trick, play moves left.
  You must follow suit if you can.
  Within a suit higher number cards win against lower number cards.
  If a joker is played the player who played the lowest card in the trick may swap cards in their hand for cards in one of the Skat Bars.
  If both jokers are played, the players who played the 2 lowest cards each choose a Skat Bar to swap from.
  Ties are resolved with the following suit order: Clubs > Spades > Hearts > Diamond
Scoring:
  The player who wins the trick takes all the cards in the trick.
  Players get points for every card they take.
  The jokers are worth 4 points, every other card is worth it's number.
  The player with the most points wins.
